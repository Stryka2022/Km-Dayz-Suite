Use it while developing. Normal launches the dedicated DayZServer_x64.exe with packed PBOs, for production.";

    public const string FilePatching =
        "-filePatching loads loose, unpacked script files from your mod folders instead of from packed PBOs, so you can iterate on Enforce Script without rebuilding. Dev only — production runs packed, signed PBOs.";

DayZ resolves a bare template name against the DayZ install, NOT this instance — so a server with edited CE/types in its own mpmissions would silently run the install's mission. \"Fix\" rewrites the template to this instance's absolute mission path.";
