# Changelog

All notable changes to dzl are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the app is versioned by
git tag (`v*`), which the release workflow turns into a Velopack release.

## [0.1.35-km.15] - 2026-08-30

### Added
- Every server row now opens a single per-instance management workspace with instance paths,
  graphical `serverDZ.cfg` settings, Workshop update/key policy, file and log locations, mod load
  order, and launch parameters.
- The graphical server settings page manages identity/passwords, MOTD, player and login limits,
  whitelist/signatures, time and lighting, render distances, voice, ping and FPS thresholds while
  preserving unknown config entries and keeping a `.km-backup` before every save.

### Changed
- Workshop **Install** is now a complete selected-server operation: it obtains the content and copies
  it into `<selected instance>\@Workshop_<item id>`, copies public keys for that instance, and adds
  only that local path to its loadout. **Update** refreshes and replaces that instance's managed copy.
- Instance rows now use an explicit **Manage** action, so selecting a server and entering its settings
  are one step. Workshop target copy destinations are shown directly in the browser and editor.

### Fixed
- Server loadouts no longer point at the shared `DayZProjects\workshop` SteamCMD cache. Uninstalling a
  target removes its instance-local mod folder and loadout entry while retaining the shared download
  for other servers.

## [0.1.35-km.14] - 2026-08-30

### Added
- Workshop results now show a green tick on the selected item, and an enabled target mod exposes a
  checked **Uninstall from target** action so its active-server state is immediately visible.
- The Workshop browser now has draggable filter/details splitters plus an **Expand details** control
  that gives the selected mod the full content width and restores the lists with one click.

### Changed
- Workshop actions now use explicit state-aware labels: **Install** before a local download,
  **Update** when files are present, and **Uninstall from target** when the mod is in the selected
  server's loadout. Removing it from one target keeps the shared download for other servers.

### Fixed
- Detail and collection action buttons now wrap instead of being clipped by the former fixed
  410-pixel details column.

## [0.1.35-km.13] - 2026-08-29

### Added
- Every online instance row now has independent Start and Stop controls, a live PID badge and
  per-instance process tracking, so several DayZ servers can run together while **Use** only selects
  the instance being edited.
- Existing split-layout instances can install their verified DayZ runtime into the instance/config
  folder from the row menu. Instance configuration, mission, profiles and persistence are preserved.

### Changed
- New online instances default to one complete runnable folder containing `DayZServer_x64.exe`,
  `serverDZ.cfg`, `mpmissions`, profiles and runtime files. Interrupted runtime copies remain
  resumable without damaging the instance-owned content.
- A new instance can seed itself from the active instance's already-verified runtime before trying
  the global install or SteamCMD, making additional servers independent of another Steam sign-in.
- Each instance now receives a distinct `instanceId` and Steam query port (`game port + 3`), and new
  port selection reserves both ports to prevent collisions between concurrently running servers.

### Fixed
- Starting one named server no longer overwrites another server's tracked PID or blocks other
  instances from starting. Legacy singleton process state is migrated to the active named instance.

## [0.1.35-km.12] - 2026-08-29

### Added
- Dedicated server instances can now be installed or repaired again from their row menu. Interrupted
  installs remain as recoverable instances with their partial files and configured destination intact.

### Changed
- New isolated instances are seeded from an already-installed official DayZ Dedicated Server when one
  is configured. The resumable copy reports progress and avoids SteamCMD authentication and a second
  multi-gigabyte download.
- When no reusable local server is available, the SteamCMD fallback now explains that it has a separate
  interactive sign-in and that password characters are intentionally hidden in its console.

### Fixed
- Closing or interrupting SteamCMD no longer deletes the newly-created instance, and its Windows cancel
  exit code now produces actionable sign-in and retry guidance.
- Steam QR/password session copy no longer implies that SteamCMD inherits the SteamKit session.

## [0.1.35-km.11] - 2026-08-29

### Changed
- Entering the embedded Server Manager now switches only the required workspace layout instead of
  recounting every unrelated editor collection. Startup navigation retries are coalesced, and the
  file-channel and attachment watchdogs stop polling aggressively after the native window attaches.
- The KM navigation button now updates the actual grid column and rail visibility, making collapse
  and Focus mode deterministic even while the separately-running Server Manager HWND is embedded.

### Fixed
- Removed window-level XAML icon references that were not packaged as WPF resources and caused
  `TypeConverterMarkupExtension` / `Cannot locate resource 'assets/icon.ico'` at Server Manager
  startup. The executable still uses the KM DayZ Suite icon through its native application icon.

## [0.1.35-km.10] - 2026-08-28

### Changed
- The Server Manager executable and WPF windows now use the KM DayZ Suite application icon.
- Steam QR codes are larger and use SteamKit's recommended low-error-correction payload, with an
  explicit refresh action and clearer mobile approval state.

### Fixed
- QR and password sign-in now use SteamKit's supported Steam Client session identity instead of the
  mismatched WebBrowser/Client request that prevented reliable completion.
- Starting a password sign-in cancels the active QR attempt (and vice versa) without allowing the
  stale attempt to overwrite the newer result. Cancelling an attempt also releases any pending Steam
  Guard prompt.
- A login is only shown as saved after its DPAPI-protected refresh token can be decrypted again.
  Corrupt or empty session files no longer make the UI report that Steam is signed in, and tokens are
  isolated per configuration rather than shared through a process-wide cache.

## [0.1.35-km.9] - 2026-08-28

### Added
- New server instances detect the preferred active LAN IPv4 address and expose refresh controls on
  both the creation form and existing instance editor.

### Fixed
- Dedicated installs now resolve a chosen parent folder to an isolated `<safe server name>` folder,
  authenticate with the configured Steam account, and only succeed after `DayZServer_x64.exe` is
  present. SteamCMD errors such as `No subscription` are surfaced instead of accepting an empty
  `steamapps` folder.
- A failed dedicated install removes the newly-created instance record/scaffold while retaining
  partial Steam files for a safe retry. Successful instances store the resolved install path, switch
  to normal server mode, and write the display name to `serverDZ.cfg` as the public hostname.

## [0.1.35-km.8] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed
- The Server Instances page now treats read-only folder and port metadata as display-only bindings,
  preventing the `FolderName` binding exception when one or more server cards are rendered.
- Repeated identical UI exceptions are coalesced so one failure cannot create a cascade of error
  dialogs while the underlying fault is still logged.

## [0.1.35-km.7] - 2026-08-28

### Added
- **Single-window KM integration.** The active server editor and setup wizard now render as inline
  Server Manager pages. The KM left rail remains the sole visible navigation while embedded, with
  direct destinations for instances, Workshop, notifications and updates, mods, economy, FTP/RCon,
  logs, bases, tools, setup, MCP, settings and legal information.
- **Friendly isolated instances.** New servers accept a display name, a filesystem-safe unique
  folder name, an editable collision-free random port, and an optional per-instance DayZ Dedicated
  Server installation.
- **Cross-platform runtime reporting.** Setup/About report Windows or Linux, CPU architecture,
  installed .NET SDKs/runtimes and .NET 11 availability. The headless CLI exposes the same probe as
  `aph-havoc environment` (or `env`), with optional `--json` output.

### Changed
- Embedded navigation uses a registered Windows message with a small file-channel startup fallback,
  avoiding duplicate page loads and visible white transition frames.
- The complete GPL application, notices, licence and matching modified source remain packaged as a
  separate process beneath `ThirdParty/APH-Havoc-Server-Manager`.

## [0.1.35] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- **DayZ Server path (normal mode).** Settings → Paths now has a **DayZ Server (normal mode)** field
  (`dayz_server_path` in config) for the separate Steam dedicated-server install
  (`...\DayZServer`). Normal mode launches `DayZServer_x64.exe` from there; debug mode still uses
  `DayZDiag_x64.exe` from the game install. Blank falls back to the DayZ game folder. Auto-detect
  and the setup wizard persist the path. CLI: `dzl config set dayz_server_path <path>`.

### Changed
- The env check for the dedicated server exe (`server_exe_normal`) only runs when
  `dayz_server_path` is set — debug-only setups no longer get a permanent
  "DayZServer_x64.exe not found" warning.

## [0.1.34] - 2026-07-05

### Added
- **Offline sandbox instances.** Tick *Offline mode* when creating a server and you get a client-only
  instance — no server, no port, no connect. The dashboard hides the whole server side and the client
  **Start** button just boots the game locally. On any instance you can now also **Start (offline)**
  (formerly "Menu only") alongside **Start (online)** — load your mods + mission without joining a
  server. `dzl server new --offline` and the MCP `new_server` do the same.
- **Offline mission patch (one click).** A stock DayZ mission doesn't spawn a character when you launch
  it offline, so the game hangs on load. The dashboard's new **Offline mission** card detects this and
  the **Patch init.c** button injects a tiny bootstrap (backing up the original) so you drop straight
  into the world — it wraps the mission's own logic, so it works on any map and is a no-op for real
  servers. A copy-code button is there as a hand-edit fallback.
- **Dev tools (offline).** *My Mods → Dev tools* installs **DzlDevTools** into your workspace — an
  in-game object editor, free camera, teleport and item spawner for offline testing, with rebindable
  keys in the game's own Controls screen. It ships with the app (editable source + a ready-to-use
  PBO); enable `@DzlDevTools` (client side) in a mod loadout to use it. (Adapted from Arkensor's
  DayZ Community Offline Mode, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.)
- **Mod presets (loadouts)** — see 0.1.33 below (first release to ship it).

### Changed
- The **Servers** tab is now **Instances** (it covers offline sandboxes too), and starting a target
  that's already running is refused instead of spawning a duplicate; the Start/Stop/Restart buttons
  now enable/disable with the live state.

## [0.1.33] - 2026-07-05

### Added
- **Mod presets (loadouts).** Save your current mod loadout under a name and switch between saved
  loadouts in one click — or start a brand-new server with one already applied. A preset stores the
  *enabled* mods (with their load order and server/client side); applying it turns those on in that
  order and everything else off, taking effect on the next server start.
  - **Mods page** gets a new "Mod presets" card: every saved preset with a content preview, an
    *applied* badge showing which one the active server runs, one-click **Apply**, delete, and an
    inline "save current loadout as…" box.
  - **Server editor (Mods tab)** gets a preset combo that applies on selection, with a *(modified)*
    hint when the loadout has drifted from the preset, plus save-as / update / delete.
  - **New server** form (and `dzl server new --mods <preset>`) can apply a preset to the fresh
    instance right away.
  - **CLI**: `dzl modpreset` (list), `modpreset save|apply|rm <name>`. **MCP**: `list_mod_presets`,
    `save_mod_preset`, `apply_mod_preset` — so Claude can switch loadouts too.
  - Presets live as plain JSON in `<ProjectsRoot>\mod-presets\` and are shared by all servers;
    names are case-insensitive.

## [0.1.32] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- **Detach a log into its own window.** Each pane has a pop-out button that opens that log in a separate,
  resizable window — handy for watching the RPT on a second monitor while you work in the main app. The main
  page greys the pane with a Bring-back placeholder while it's detached; closing the window re-attaches it. The
  filter, search and auto-scroll stay in sync between the two views (they share the same live data). Any or all
  panes can be detached at once, in every view mode.

## [0.1.31] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- **Syntax-coloured log viewer (AvalonEdit).** The log panes now render through a real code/log editor:
  per-token colouring (timestamp, subsystem, `(E)`/`(W)` severity, quoted strings, ADM `pos=<…>`), faint
  red/amber tint on error/warning lines, **gutter line numbers**, and **search-match highlighting** in the
  visible text. Stack-trace file references (`scripts/…/foo.c : 339`, absolute `…\init.c : 97`) are
  underlined and **clickable — they open the file at that line in your configured editor** (absolute paths
  always; relative script paths resolved best-effort against the projects root and the mounted P: drive).
- **Fifth log pane: Console.** `server_console.log` is now tailed alongside script/RPT/ADM/client — the
  cleanest startup + Central Economy overview (`SUCCESS:`, `[CE][Hive] :: …`, mission/map load). In Grid
  view it spans the full width on its own row.

## [0.1.30] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- **The Logs viewer got search, quick filters and an auto-scroll toggle.** Every log pane (script/RPT/ADM/client,
  in any view mode) now has its own toolbar: a **search box** (live, case-insensitive substring), **quick-filter
  chips** — All · Errors · Warnings · Connections · Mods/Success — that narrow the pane to just those lines, an
  **Auto-scroll** toggle (turn it off to read older lines without being yanked to the tail), and a new **Open in
  editor** button that opens the full log file in your configured editor. A footer shows "Showing N of M lines"
  so it's clear how much the filter/search is hiding. Filtering is in-memory over the live tail; the underlying
  file is never touched.

## [0.1.29] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed
- **A partial pack build no longer wipes the other PBOs.** Building a subset of a pack's inner mods (e.g. just
  `world`) now **swaps only those PBOs** and keeps the rest in `@<pack>\Addons` — changing one file no longer
  means repacking (and risking) every addon. Building **all** of them still does a clean full rebuild that also
  clears any stale PBO.

## [0.1.28] - 2026-06-28

### Changed
- **Tools "Pack PBO" is now a full build console.** It matches a My Mods build, just on a manually-picked
  source/output folder: a **Preflight** button (findings + counts), **binarize**, **sign with a configured key**
  (dropdown from Settings → Signing, not a manual key-path field anymore), and **"build anyway"** to pack past
  preflight errors. Same pipeline (preflight → Binarize → CfgConvert → in-process pack → sign).

## [0.1.27] - 2026-06-28

### Changed
- **Tools "Pack PBO" now uses the in-process build engine.** Packing a folder no longer goes through
  AddonBuilder — it uses the same reliable in-process PBO writer as the My Mods builds. A new **binarize**
  toggle: off packs the folder as-is (no external tools or P: needed); on runs the full build (binarize models +
  `config.cpp`→`config.bin`, needs the P: work drive mounted). Set a key path to sign. The Pack button is always
  available now (no AddonBuilder dependency).

## [0.1.26] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- **My Mods detects broken links.** A mod imported as a link whose source folder was later moved or deleted no
  longer silently disappears (leaving dead junctions behind in `mods\` and on `P:`). It now shows as an amber
  **"broken link"** card with two fixes: **Re-link…** (point it at the new source folder) or **Remove** (clear
  the leftover junctions). Dangling junctions are also reliably detected and removable now (previously a
  reparse-point whose target was gone slipped past the link checks).

## [0.1.25] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed
- **Deleting a link-imported mod/pack can no longer touch the external source.** A project imported as a link
  (junction) now shows **"Remove from projects (keep source)"** instead of "Delete…", and removing it drops only
  the junction — the original source folder is left completely untouched. The force-delete is now reparse-point
  safe too, so it can never recurse into a junction's target and wipe files behind it.

## [0.1.24] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed
- **My Mods pack header spacing.** The ⋯ actions button no longer sits jammed against the group's expander
  chevron, and the pack header has a little vertical breathing room (matching the standalone-mod cards).

## [0.1.23] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- **Import a mod by link or copy.** The Add → Import dialog now has a "Copy into projects" option. Off
  (default) keeps the current behaviour — links the source in place via a junction, so it stays where it is and
  edits affect the original. On copies the whole folder into your projects as an independent copy you can change
  without touching the source.

## [0.1.22] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed
- **My Mods no longer breaks when a mod folder is deleted or moved.** A `mods\` entry that couldn't be read —
  a dead junction whose target was moved/deleted, or a folder that vanished mid-scan — made project discovery
  throw *"Could not find a part of the path"*, which wiped the **whole** My Mods list and popped an error.
  Such entries are now skipped, so the rest of your mods still load.

## [0.1.21] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- **Pack groups get the same ⋯ actions menu as standalone mods.** A pack's header on My Mods now has the
  "More actions" dropdown (Open folder, Open in editor, Link/Unlink P:, Delete pack) and the Open-on-GitHub
  button — matching standalone mods, instead of just Build / Git / Open-folder.

## [0.1.20] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- **Dev server defaults to `-limitFPS=120`.** The debug server params now include `-limitFPS=120`, which caps
  server FPS to cut CPU usage on a low-population dev server. Applies to **newly created** configs/instances;
  existing ones keep their current params (add it yourself if you want it). Normal/production mode is unchanged
  (uncapped).

## [0.1.19] - 2026-06-28

### Changed
- **My Mods pack groups start collapsed by default.** Packs now begin collapsed; only the ones you explicitly
  expand are remembered (still persisted across refreshes and restarts). Keeps the My Mods list compact when you
  have many packs.

## [0.1.18] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- **My Mods remembers collapsed pack groups.** Collapsing a pack's group now sticks — across list refreshes
  (build / link / import / delete) and app restarts — instead of snapping back open every time the list
  rebuilds. Stored in a small `ui-state.json` next to the config (separate from presets, so it's pure view
  state).

## [0.1.17] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed
- **Game-data extraction now unpacks vanilla only — not your mods.** The extractor enumerated PBOs recursively
  under the DayZ install and followed junctions into `!Workshop\@<mod>` (and loose `@<mod>`) folders, so a
  machine with many subscribed mods tried to unpack **thousands** of mod PBOs (e.g. 3600+) into `P:`. It now
  skips any `@`- or `!`-prefixed folder and extracts only the game's own data (`Addons`, `sakhal\Addons`, `dta`,
  …) — back to roughly the real vanilla count.

## [0.1.16] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed
- **Pack inner mods now get a unique PBO prefix.** A pack child with no `$PBOPREFIX$` of its own was packed
  with just its folder name as the prefix (e.g. a terrain child → `prefix=world`). That collides with vanilla
  and other mods and breaks loading — a map's `worldName` (`<pack>\world\<map>.wrp`) couldn't be found
  ("Cannot load world"). It now falls back to the unique pack-relative path `<pack>\<child>` (how pboProject
  derives it from the folder layout), so terrains and assets resolve. Children that already ship a `$PBOPREFIX$`
  are unchanged.

## [0.1.15] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- **Reliable in-app game-data extraction.** A new **Extract game data** action (Tools page + the first-run
  wizard) unpacks every vanilla PBO to the `P:` drive directly via DayZ Tools' `BankRev`, instead of going
  through `WorkDrive.exe`'s built-in extract. It's **incremental** — a manifest skips PBOs already extracted at
  their current version, and a **full re-extract** toggle forces everything — and it shows per-PBO progress.
  This gives dzl a controllable, scriptable extraction that doesn't depend on the WorkDrive GUI.

## [0.1.14] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- **"Build anyway" on the pack build console.** Preflight still runs and reports its findings, but its
  errors no longer block the build. This is for map/world mods that reference vanilla assets which aren't
  extracted on your `P:` drive (e.g. an `.emat` terrain/ocean material the engine resolves at runtime) — the
  resulting "missing referenced file" errors are false positives, and you can now build past them without
  turning off preflight globally. (`BuildService.Build`/`BuildPack` gained an `ignorePreflightErrors` option.)

## [0.1.13] - 2026-06-27

### Changed
- **Builds pack the PBO in-process — no more FileBank/AddonBuilder.** A new built-in PBO writer assembles the
  `.pbo` directly (stored/uncompressed, with the `$PBOPREFIX$` and a SHA-1 trailer), so a build never depends on
  an external packer or the DayZ file server for packing. This removes a whole class of hangs and naming quirks
  and makes packing deterministic.

### Fixed
- **Binarize now gets the project-drive context it needs — no more hangs, no more "Material not loaded".**
  `binarize.exe` is invoked with `-binpath`/`-addon` pointed at the mounted `P:\` work drive (plus `-always`,
  `-silent`, `-maxProcesses`, `-textures`) and run with its working directory set there. With that context it
  resolves vanilla **and** the mod's own materials (so a vehicle/model mod no longer floods the log with
  "Material not loaded …rvmat"), runs roughly an order of magnitude faster, and accepts staging that lives off
  the work drive — which is what made model mods (e.g. a Land Rover) appear to never finish.
- **Build doesn't run binarize when there's nothing to binarize.** A mod with no MLOD models (config/script-only,
  or only already-binarized ODOL models) skips Binarize entirely instead of churning for ~35s per mod — so a
  pack of mostly-config mods builds in seconds and the log stays clean.
- **Captured process runs can't deadlock on a lingering child.** `binarize.exe` spawns a persistent file-server
  child that inherits the output pipe; the process runner now waits on the process handle (not the streams' EOF)
  with a bounded drain, so a build no longer hangs after binarize itself has finished.

## [0.1.12] - 2026-06-27

### Changed
- **New build engine (no AddonBuilder).** Mod and pack builds now run a direct DayZ-Tools pipeline —
  `binarize.exe` → `CfgConvert` (config.cpp→config.bin) → `FileBank.exe` (pack) → `DSSignFile` (sign) —
  giving per-file control AddonBuilder didn't expose.

### Fixed
- **Already-binarized (ODOL) p3d no longer crash the build.** Such models are excluded from Binarize and
  shipped unchanged (verified byte-identical in the output PBO), while the rest of the mod still binarizes
  normally — so a mod/pack containing pre-binarized models builds instead of dying with an access
  violation (0xC0000005). AddonBuilder's `-include` cannot do this (confirmed by testing).

## [0.1.11] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed
- **Pack build console — scrollable mod list.** The "Mods to build" list is now height-capped with
  a scrollbar, so a pack with many mods no longer pushes the options and build log off-screen.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-06-27

### Changed
- **Pack build console — tidier mod list.** "Mods to build" is now a proper selectable list: each
  mod is a row with a checkbox, name and a marker chip (`config.cpp` / `$PBOPREFIX$`), with a
  "select all" toggle + a selected count, and the build options (binarize / sign / key) separated
  below a divider.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- **Mod packs on My Mods.** A folder whose subfolders are each a mod (own `config.cpp` /
  `$PBOPREFIX$`) is auto-detected as a *pack* and shown as an expandable group (named after the
  folder, with git at the pack level) instead of being invisible. One level of nesting.
- **"Build pack…".** Build a pack's inner mods into one `@<pack>` — a PBO per mod under `Addons\`
  plus a shared `keys\`, published atomically and registered as a single loadable mod. The console
  lets you pick which inner mods to build (all by default), choose binarize/sign + key, and shows
  per-mod preflight tabs with the same findings UX as the single-mod build (severity badges,
  clickable `file:line`).

### Fixed
- **Wrong PBO prefix when building a pack child.** AddonBuilder derived the prefix from the nested
  source's leaf folder; the child's own `$PBOPREFIX$` is now passed explicitly (`-prefix=`), so
  assets resolve at the right root.
- **Preflight false-positive on multi-segment `$PBOPREFIX$`.** `cfgmods-folder-unreferenced` (and
  include/path resolution generally) only stripped the first prefix segment, so a mod with a prefix
  like `Mod\Core` was wrongly flagged. References that open with the whole prefix now resolve.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- **Search box on the mod-selection lists.** The server editor's Mods tab now has a filter
  (shared with the main Mods page), and the My Mods projects list filters by name / path.

### Fixed
- **The "claude mcp add" command on the MCP page pointed at a missing path on the installed
  app.** The MCP server ships isolated in an `mcp\` subfolder as a self-contained
  `dzl-mcp.exe` (its .NET 10 deps would poison the net8 Tray if merged into the root). The
  command now resolves `mcp\dzl-mcp.exe` instead of a non-existent `Dzl.Mcp.dll` in the root.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed
- **Per-instance `serverDZ.cfg` is now actually honored.** The server is launched with
  an absolute `-config` path (accepted by DayZ 1.29). The previous approach relied on the
  working directory, but the engine forces `$currentdir` to the exe folder — so every
  instance silently loaded the DayZ *install's* `serverDZ.cfg` instead of its own.
- **Per-instance mission / Central Economy is now honored.** A server's `serverDZ.cfg`
  mission `template` is repointed at the instance's own `mpmissions` (absolute path) when
  the instance is created and on every launch, so the engine loads the instance's mission
  — the one dzl's CE editor manages — not the install's.
- **New servers no longer inherit a previous instance's mission.** Creating an instance
  repoints its `Mission` at its own folder instead of copying the active preset's value
  (which could be an absolute path to a different instance).
- **Folder / file pickers open where the field points.** Across the server editor,
  settings, tools, add-mod, module settings and key import, the "browse" buttons now start
  in the directory the field already contains (the parent directory for file fields),
  falling back to the projects root / DayZ folder — instead of always jumping to the DayZ
  install.

### Added
- **Dashboard "Mission source" card.** Shows which `mpmissions` folder the server will
  actually load (instance / install / missing), read from `serverDZ.cfg`, with a one-click
  "Fix" that repoints the template at the instance's own mission.
