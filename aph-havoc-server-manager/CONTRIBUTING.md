# Contributing to APH Havoc Server Manager

Thanks for your interest in improving APH Havoc! This is a DayZ server and
mod-development manager built on .NET. Bug reports, fixes, features, and docs are
all welcome.

## Ways to contribute

- **Report a bug** or **request a feature** via the
  [issue tracker](https://github.com/Stryka2022/Km-Dayz-Suite/issues) — use the templates so
  the version and environment details come through up front.
- **Improve the public documentation** in this repository.
- **Send a pull request** for a fix or feature.

## Getting set up

You need the **[.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)**, plus
**DayZ** and **DayZ Tools** (from Steam) if you want to exercise the launcher end to end.

```powershell
dotnet build Dzl.sln -c Debug      # build everything
dotnet test                        # run the tests (xUnit + FluentAssertions)
.\run-dzl.bat                      # build + launch the tray, de-elevated via explorer.exe
```

`run-dzl.bat` launches the tray **de-elevated** on purpose: the tray mounts the **P:**
work drive, and a mounted drive is only visible in the session that mounted it. Prefer
this script over `dotnet run` for the tray.

> If the tray app is running it can lock the solution build. Run a focused test project
> instead, e.g. `dotnet test tests/Dzl.Core.Tests`.

## Architecture in one minute

Frontends are thin; all real work lives in **`Dzl.Core`**:

```
Dzl.Cli  ─┐
Dzl.Mcp  ─┼─> Dzl.Core (LauncherService = the one entry point)
Dzl.Tray ─┘
```

When you add a capability, add it to `LauncherService` first, then surface it in each
frontend (CLI, MCP, tray). The internal `Dzl.*` identifiers remain for compatibility
with existing installations and the original GPL program.

## Coding conventions

- **Warnings are errors.** `TreatWarningsAsErrors` is on globally — a warning fails the
  build. Keep the tree clean.
- **Records + immutable `with` updates** for config and state; split pure helpers out
  from I/O so they can be unit-tested (`ArgvBuilder`, the `WorkDrive` arg-builders).
- **Process wrappers around external exes never throw** — they return `(ok, output)` or
  a bool.
- **MCP: stdout is the protocol.** All logging in `Dzl.Mcp` must go to stderr.
- Match the style of the code around you.

## Tests

Add or update tests for any behaviour change — the pure helpers are the easy,
high-value place to test. Make sure `dotnet test` is green before opening a PR.

## Branch model

| Branch | Role |
|---|---|
| `dev` | Integration — **all pull requests target `dev`** (it's the default branch, so new PRs pick it automatically). |
| `main` | Stable and branch-protected — direct pushes are rejected; it only advances via a `dev` → `main` pull request. Releases are cut from `main` by tagging `v*` (the release workflow builds the Velopack installer from the tag). |

Flow: branch off `dev` → PR into `dev` → maintainer PRs `dev` → `main` → tag `v*` on
`main` to release. PRs opened against `main` will be retargeted to `dev`.

## Pull requests

- Target the **`dev`** branch (see the branch model above).
- Keep PRs focused: one logical change per PR.
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) for commit subjects
  (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `ci:`, …) — the history follows this.
- Fill in the PR template and link any related issue.
- By contributing, you agree your work is licensed under the project's
  **[GPL-3.0](LICENSE)**.
